		<Part ActorName="Player">There is not much I can do here.</Part>
		
		<Part ActorName="SideKick">Hey! What's going on?</Part>
		
		<Part ActorName="Soldier">Ennemies found a way to the prison and killed the General.</Part>
		
		<Part ActorName="SideKick">So what? Why don't you stay and fight?</Part>
		
		<Part ActorName="Soldier">You don't understand. He was the last General. This army
    has no commander anymore. It's over.</Part>
